            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;SCHOOL HISTORY:<br />
                • My education and where it was done, years: Primary school in
                Mexico, secondary school in Canada and college in Canada as well.
            <p>
                • In my school: I had a normal experience back in primary school.
                However, my school experience in secondary school was rather particular
                as I did not enjoy my time studying at a French high school. Now in college
                I feel happy with my school experience as I am finally studying something
                I am passionate about.
            </p>
            <p>
                • Were was I the most successful at in school,well, I was not the most
                successful at primary school nor at secondary school. Thus far, my college
                experience has been very successful personally.
            </p>
            <p>
                • While studying at a
                French high school I would say that the most difficult thing for me was
                my French classes, as well as having to deal with rather difficult
                classmates and also having to graduate in the midst of a pandemic.

            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;WORK HISTORY:<br />
                • My first job was at
                five guys as a crew member, what it means is that I needed to know how to do a
                little bit of everything. Then, I got laid out of that job for external circumstances
                and I was unemployed for about 4 months until I started working again during
                February as a barista at a café in old port.
            <p>
                • At my current job what I
                find the most difficult is the long hours one has to spend working on their
                feet but apart from that, having to deal with management I’d say.
